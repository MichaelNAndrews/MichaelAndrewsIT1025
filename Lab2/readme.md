# Executive Summary
## Hardware
The **central processing unit**, or **CPU**, can be thought of as the brains of the computer.
| **CPU** (Central Processing Unit)        |                                                    |
|:----------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|RAM         | The computer's "working memory". Data in RAM is lost if computer loses power.    | 
|Registers   | Special memory locations that can be accessed quickly.                           |
|Buses       | Electrical connections between different computer components. The "data highway".|
|ALU         | "Arithmetic / Logic Unit". Performs all the calculations of the CPU.             |
|Control Unit| Responsible for directing flow of instructions and data within CPU.              |
#### Hard Drives and Memory
**Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**
- Store data for longer term use. 
- "Non-Volatile" storage, meaning data remains even after computer loses power.
- Data is stored on a disk.
Because Hard Disk Drives utilize an array of moving parts in their functioning, they can be somewhat complex and slow in efficiency. 
**Solid State Drives (SSD)** have been popularized to escape the complexities and slower performance of HDD's.
