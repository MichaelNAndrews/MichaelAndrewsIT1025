|RAM         | The computer's "working memory". Data in RAM is lost if computer loses power.    | 
|Registers   | Special memory locations that can be accessed quickly.                           |
|Buses       | Electrical connections between different computer components. The "data highway".|
|ALU         | "Arithmetic / Logic Unit". Performs all the calculations of the CPU.             |
|Control Unit| Responsible for directing flow of instructions and data within CPU               |
