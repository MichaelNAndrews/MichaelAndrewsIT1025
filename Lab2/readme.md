# Executive Summary
## Hardware
The **central processing unit**, or **CPU**, can be thought of as the brains of the computer.
| **CPU** (Central Processing Unit)        |                                                    |
|:----------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|RAM         | The computer's "working memory". Data in RAM is lost if computer loses power.    | 
|Registers   | Special memory locations that can be accessed quickly.                           |
|Buses       | Electrical connections between different computer components. The "data highway".|
|ALU         | "Arithmetic / Logic Unit". Performs all the calculations of the CPU.             |
|Control Unit| Responsible for directing flow of instructions and data within CPU.              |
#### Hard Drives and Memory
**Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**
- Store data for longer term use. 
- "Non-Volatile" storage, meaning data remains even after computer loses power.
- Data is stored on a disk.

Because Hard Disk Drives utilize an array of moving parts in their functioning, they can be somewhat complex and slow in efficiency. 

**Solid State Drives (SSD)** have been popularized to escape the complexities and slower performance of HDD's.

Information on SSD's can be accessed instantly, at the speed of light, so there is no latency experienced when data is transferred.

#### ALU and the Control Unit
The **control unit** receives instructions from RAM and then instructs the **Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU)** what operation to perform.

The ALU will then perform the operation and provide an answer in the form of an output. 

Depending on the instruction, the ALU may not output an answer but will instead use **"flags"** to help control unit determine what to do with next instruction.

#### CPU, Input & Output
#### Logic Gates and Circuits

A **Logic Gate** is an electric circuit with two inputs and one output, the output depends upon the rule that the two inputs are filtered through.

These rules by which the inputs are interpreted are the logic gates and there are several very common forms:

**AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, **XOR (Exclusive Or)**, **NAND (NOT AND)**, and **NOR (NOT OR)**
