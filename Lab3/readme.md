Centralized database software application that can be implemented for organizations (large and small) to help manage and review information essential to daily operations.

Examples of popular Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software include Microsoft Dynamics and NetSuite by Oracle.

## Virtualization

**Virtualization** allows you to create multiple simulated environments or dedicated resources from a single, physical hardware system.

This process allows you to use a physical machineâ€™s full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many users or environments, thereby allowing a business to get the most value from previous investments in hardware.

Virtualization is made possible by a **hypervisor**  which is software that connects directly to  hardware and allows you to split a single system into separate, distinct, and secure environments known as **virtual machines**. 

### Virtualization vs. Cloud Computing

While the two may often be confused with one another, virtualization should be regarded as a **_technology_** and cloud computing should be regarded as an **_implemented practice_** or **_methodolgy_**. 

## Python

**Python** is a programming language that is distinguished by its simple and easy to read format which has gave way to its notoriety as a *Pseudo-Code Language*.

Python is regarded to as pseudo-code because it reads more like English than code which allows for more emphasis on problem-solving than the language syntax and coding nuances.
