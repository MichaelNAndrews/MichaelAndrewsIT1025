### Executive Summary
Lab 1 of IT1025 serves as an introduction to computing history and lays the foundation for the understanding of basic information system components. From an overview of IBM's technological preeminence and influence throughout the 20th century to a crashcourse on utilizing GitHub, IT1025 will help students explore the IT field and gain a clearer direction in their pursuit of becoming versed in computer and information technology. 
### Information System Components
Information systems can be viewed as having five major components: **_hardware, software, data, people_**, and **_processes_**.
#### In Everyday Life...
**Smartphones** are likely the most actively used information system in current modern day life.
Smartphones consist of several **hardware** components such as the display (usually LCD or LED), battery, modem, memory chip, and the system on a chip. Additionally, smartphones now come equipped with cameras and sensors to allow for touch-enabled functionality. 

**Software** for most smartphones either utilize Google Android or Apple Operating Systems. 

While smartphones allow for users to access **data** through the use of apps and access to the internet, smartphones also collect data about its user - ranging from basic contact/personal information such as name, phone number, e-mail address all the way to the users location, app/account usage, and even total screen time. 

As the most convenient and readily accessible information system available, smartphones encompass a wide range of **people** who act as users and interact with apps. There are also those who serve as developers for apps and the software which drives the apps/programs available on smartphones.

The power of micro-computing that smartphones provide to us allow for a wide range of **processes** to be executed on a daily basis. From serving as internet communicators, to making phone calls and sending text messaged, to even being handheld video game machines, smarthpones enhance our lives by making the world feel smaller and serving to connect users with more information than ever before.

#### GitHub
  #### Client-Server Architecture
  Git-Hub utilizes **Client-Server Architecture** which obviously consist of two components: the client & the server. 
  The **Client-Side** consists of any action that can be performed separate from being connected to the internet - for instance, programming language like JavaScript can be understood by almost any computer, so a connection to a server is not required to perform action using JavaScript.
  
  On the otherhand, to perform action with programming language not known by the computer, access to a **server** will be required. The difference between client-side and server-side in this sense depends on what a user can do without being connected to the internet and what one can only do by being connected to the internet.
  
 **GitHub desktop** is an example of the client-side - as the GitHub desktop tool is designed so users can interact and work with GitHub without connecting through their browser.
  
  #### Cloud Computing
  
  GitHub also exemplifies **Cloud Computing** as - to use the definition from microsoft.com (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/) - "cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale."
  
GitHub allows for us to write and commit changes from one device and share them to any device that has permissions to our repository. Users with permissions are thus also able to edit and commit their own changes independent of their geographic location in relation to the initial user. 

**The cloud** creates a shared space that exists anywhere (so long as their is internet connectivity) to make, share, and contribute ideas.
