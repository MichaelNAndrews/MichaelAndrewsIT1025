### Executive Summary
Lab 1 of IT1025 serves as an introduction to computing history and lays the foundation for the understanding of basic information system components. From an overview of IBM's technological preeminence and influence throughout the 20th century to a crashcourse on utilizing GitHub, IT1025 will help students explore the IT field and gain a clearer direction in their pursuit of becoming versed in computer and information technology. 
### Information System Components
Information systems can be viewed as having five major components: **_hardware, software, data, people_**, and **_processes_**.
#### In Everyday Life...
**Smartphones** are likely the most actively used information system in current modern day life.
Smartphones consist of several **hardware** components such as the display (usually LCD or LED), battery, modem, memory chip, and the system on a chip. Additionally, smartphones now come equipped with cameras and sensors to allow for touch-enabled functionality. 

**Software** for most smartphones either utilize Google Android or Apple Operating Systems. 

While smartphones allow for users to access **data** through the use of apps and access to the internet, smartphones also collect data about its user - ranging from basic contact/personal information such as name, phone number, e-mail address all the way to the users location, app/account usage, and even total screen time. 

As the most convenient and readily accessible information system available, smartphones encompass a wide range of **people** who act as users and interact with apps. There are also those who serve as developers for apps and the software which drives the apps/programs available on smartphones.

The power of micro-computing that smartphones provide to us allow for a wide range of **processes** to be executed on a daily basis. From serving as internet communicators, to making phone calls and sending text messaged, to even being handheld video game machines, smarthpones enhance our lives by making the world feel smaller and serving to connect users with more information than ever before.
